This means unmatched financial stability, ethical standards, and a global referral network of 50,000+ agents. When you're making the biggest purchase of your life, that trust matters.",
      },
      {
        q: "Is Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices owned by Warren Buffett?",
        a: "Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices is part of HSF Affiliates LLC, a joint venture of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (Warren Buffett's company) and HomeServices of America. The brand carries the trusted Berkshire Hathaway name and upholds its values.",

      {
        q: "Does using a Berkshire Hathaway agent cost more?",
        a: "No. Commission rates are negotiable and comparable to other brokerages. The value you receive—global marketing exposure, trusted brand recognition, and experienced agents—often helps homes sell faster and for more money.",
      },

  {
    title: "Buying a Home in Las Vegas",
    faqs: [
      {
        q: "How long does the home buying process take?",

      },
      {
        q: "Do I need a pre-approval before looking at homes?",

        q: "How much do I need for a down payment?",
        a: "Down payment requirements vary: FHA loans require 3.5%, conventional loans typically 3-20%, and VA/USDA loans may require 0% down. Dr. Jan can connect you with lenders who specialize in various loan programs.",
      },
      {
        q: "Is now a good time to buy in Las Vegas?",
        a: "Yes. With more inventory, returning negotiating power, and stable interest rates, buyers have more options than they've had in years. Well-priced homes still move quickly, but you won't face the bidding wars of 2021-2022.",
      },
      {
        q: "Does BHHS help with new construction homes?",
        a: "Yes! BHHS agents provide free buyer representation for new construction purchases from builders like Toll Brothers, Lennar, and Century Communities—the builder pays the commission, not you. Having representation protects your interests.",

        q: "What do I need to do to prepare my home for sale?",

      {
        q: "Should I wait for prices to go higher?",
        a: "Current appreciation of 4.2% YoY suggests prices are stable with gradual increases. Timing the market is difficult—most sellers do better by listing when ready rather than waiting. Dr. Jan can provide a personalized market analysis.",
