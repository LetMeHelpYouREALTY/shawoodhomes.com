                      <strong>Federal HOPA Guidelines:</strong> At least 80% of
                      occupied units must have one resident 55 or older. The
                      remaining 20% can include younger residents, though
                      individual communities may be more restrictive.

                      qualifying resident. Minimum ages for non-qualifying
                      residents vary (often 40-45 minimum).

                </h3>
                <p className="text-slate-600">
                  Per the Housing for Older Persons Act (HOPA), at least 80% of
                  occupied units must have one resident 55 or older. The remaining
                  20% can be younger, but some communities require all residents
                  to be 55+. Spouses can be younger in most communities.

                  Can I buy in a 55+ community if I'm under 55?
                </h3>
                <p className="text-slate-600">
                  Generally no, but there are exceptions. You may purchase if
                  you'll be 55 by close of escrow, or as an investor who will rent
                  to 55+ tenants. Some communities allow residents 45-54 in
                  limited circumstances. Dr. Jan can explain each community's
                  specific rules.

                <p className="text-slate-600">
                  HOA fees typically cover access to clubhouses, pools, fitness
                  centers, golf courses, organized activities, landscaping, and
                  exterior maintenance. Fees range from $140-$350/month depending
                  on amenities. Some communities have separate golf memberships.

                  California retirees love Las Vegas for no state income tax,
                  lower property prices (50-60% less), lower cost of living, warm
                  weather, world-class healthcare, and the ability to get more
                  home and amenities for their money. Many sell their California
                  home and buy in Las Vegas with cash to spare.

                  Yes, most communities allow guests of any age to visit and stay
                  temporarily (typically 30-90 days per year). However, children
                  cannot be permanent residents. Each community has specific guest
                  policies that Dr. Jan Duffy can explain.
