                Green Valley: Where Henderson Families Have Thrived for 35+ Years
              </h2>
              <p>
                <strong>Green Valley</strong> holds a special place in Henderson's history as the city's
                original master-planned community. Established in 1988, Green Valley pioneered the concept
                of thoughtfully designed neighborhoods in Southern Nevada—long before master-planned
                communities became the norm. Today, <strong>Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices</strong>
                continues to serve Green Valley families, helping new generations discover what long-time
                residents already know: this is one of the best places to live in Nevada.
              </p>
              <p>
                What makes Green Valley unique is something that can't be replicated: time. Over three
                decades, the community has matured into a verdant oasis with towering trees, established
                landscaping, and a genuine neighborhood feel. While newer communities offer shiny amenities,
                Green Valley offers something more valuable—proven schools with track records of excellence,
                neighbors who've built lifelong friendships, and the kind of community cohesion that only
                develops over generations.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Nevada Properties</strong> agents have been selling
                homes in Green Valley since the beginning. Dr. Jan Duffy knows which streets offer the best
                mountain views, which school zones are most sought-after, and which HOAs maintain their
                communities to the highest standards. This institutional knowledge, combined with the
                resources and reputation of BHHS, gives Green Valley buyers and sellers a distinct advantage.

                    privacy, and a sense of permanence. Many homes feature larger lots than you'll find in
                    newer developments, with mature fruit trees and professional landscaping.

                Working with a <strong>Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices</strong> agent in Green Valley
                means understanding the subtle differences between Green Valley proper, Green Valley Ranch,
                and Green Valley South. Each area has distinct characteristics, price points, and lifestyle
                offerings. Dr. Jan Duffy helps buyers navigate these nuances and find the perfect fit—whether
                that's a starter home or a single-story home for someone downsizing, looking to
                downsize without leaving the community they love.

                  safety. BHHS agents can provide detailed market analysis.
